RETIRED - first real project with react/typescript - also played around with some interesting css  
The codebase is not pretty, but it will get you started with a 1st level dnd 5e character with a locally-saved HTML character sheet.  
If you really use this for a campaign, make sure to back it up - local storage can expire.  
  
run this version with: npm run dev
